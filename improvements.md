# 🧠 Improvements Made by Puneet Sharma

### 1. Embedding Cache
Added a JSON-based cache system to store computed embeddings. 
This reduces repeated API calls and speeds up subsequent queries.

### 2. search_summary() Function
Created a summarizer to combine top Pinecone and Neo4j results into a single, clean context. 
This makes the AI prompt more focused and accurate.

### 3. Enhanced Prompt Engineering
Rewrote the prompt to include structured reasoning (“Think step by step”) and better contextual cues. 
Results are more detailed and coherent.

### 4. Async-Ready Architecture
Added async scaffolding to prepare the code for parallel Pinecone and Neo4j queries in the future.

### Outcome
- Faster and more efficient responses  
- More relevant and creative travel plans  
- Reduced OpenAI token usage  
- Readable and modular design
